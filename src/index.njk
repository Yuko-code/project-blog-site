    <p>My name is Yuko, I have been learning web development
      since the beginning of 2020. It all started from the moment I played with a
      little mobile game which introduces people how to use HTML and CSS. I fell in
      love with the concept and I thought
       that this was something I could do. Of course it was made simple for people
        to get into the web developement. But the reality wasn't as easy as the game!
        Especially self-learning was lonely journey. I even gave it a break for a few months,
        focusing on dance performance (I was a Salsa dance addict!) and study in other area.

        The things got a little more serious when I started The Web Developer Bootcamp (Udemy course)
        by Colt Steele. I joined the study group on Facebook, which really helped me to get through
        the course. Everyone was so supportive and happy to exchange thier experiences and knowledge.
        The community helped me to become a web developer.

        I had no Computer Science background,
        I was bad at Math when I was in highschool (looong time ago). I was in mid 30s
        when I decided to learn all about web developement. But I managed to build some
        website projects. Now web development is a huge part of my life, somehing I feel passionate
        about. The below tweet is the feeling I have every day!
