**Overview**

This was the first project I built after I finished The Web Developer Bootcamp (Udemy course) by Colt Steele. It is similar to Yelp Camp project I built through the course, just without the user login function as it was made read-only. From the landing page, when you click the "View my Map" button, it takes you to the index page with large cluster map on top of the screen and the list of Mambo's favourite places. The viewers can go to the detailed page by clicking "see more" button or just selecting from the map. In detailed page, I also included map zoomed into the location and image carousel to display multiple images.
